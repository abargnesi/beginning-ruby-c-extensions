Beginning Ruby C extensions
---------------------------

Ruby extensions can be used to link Ruby with third party C libraries. This can be useful when native linking or performance is vital to your program. MRI (Matz's Ruby Interpreter) supports building and loading C code within your own gem.

This talk will detail what a Ruby C extension is, why you may want to use them, and how to get started. A coding demonstration will then show the entire process from inception to deployment. We will wrap up with resources for continuing your journey with Ruby C extensions.
